# SQL Scripts

You can create a directory tree full of parameterized SQL scripts that
EmbraceSQL will inspect and generate strongly typed typescript wrappers.

These wrappers are callable as async functions, with typed parameter inputs and
typed row outputs. No need to ever create 'pojo' types to get intellisense on
your queries ever again.

## Configuration

... specify the root folder where to look for scripts
