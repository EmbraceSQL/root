# Middleware

It's a common pattern: middlware. EmbraceSQL uses this pattern inside the 
database invocation stack to allow you to:

* view and modify `parameters`
* view and modify `values`

## Parameters

When EmbraceSQL say `parameters`, it means data used to filter data in `WHERE`
clauses. 

Middleware is provides the ability to `get` and `set` `parameters`.

You can use this for:
* dynamic query alternation
* security
* logging

## Values

When EmbraceSQL says `values` it means data that will be sent to and stored
in the database via `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.

Middleware is provides the ability to `get` and `set` `values`.

You can use this for:
* an in-code alternative to row modifying triggers
* default values that rely on code outside the database
* validating input that relies on code outside the database
* calling external APIs before finally going to the database
