# Middleware

It's a common pattern: middlware. EmbraceSQL uses this pattern inside the 
database invocation stack to allow you to:

* view and modify `parameters`
* view and modify `values`
* provide [security](./security)
* run additional SQL statements in the same transaction as your actual query

## Concepts

Middleware are just asynchronous functions with two parameters `(context, next)`. 

Middleware acts by working on a shared `context`. 
Modifying this shared context affects the action of subsequent
middlware and the final call of your actual query.

When your middleware is complete, you call `next` which hands off to the next
middleware.

You can throw and `Error` at any time to abort processing a request.


## Parameters

When EmbraceSQL says `parameters`, it means data used to filter data in `WHERE`
clauses. 

Middleware provides the ability to `get` and `set` `parameters`.

You can use this for:
* dynamic query alternation
* security
* logging

## Values

When EmbraceSQL says `values` it means data that will be sent to and stored
in the database via `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.

Middleware provides the ability to `get` and `set` `values`.

You can use this for:
* an in-code alternative to row modifying triggers
* default values that rely on code outside the database
* validating input that relies on code outside the database
* calling external APIs before finally going to the database

## Example

Here is an example of using middleware to affect parameters and values
hoisted up from a unit test.
