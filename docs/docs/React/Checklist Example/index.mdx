# Checklist Example

What's a framework without a todo list sample?

We'll do something a little different and make a checklist sample, so instead
of just a big list of TODO, we'll build multiple named lists to illustrate:
- Using EmbraceSQL with MUI
- Creating new rows
- Parent-child relationshipts
- Updating rows
