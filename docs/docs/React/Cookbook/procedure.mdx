# Stored Procedure

You can use stored procedures in your database as *the database API*. This is
a strange concept for folks that grew up with the database as a place where
objects go to rest when not in memory -- mere storage. But to folks that embrace
SQL, the database is a valid active player in your architecture.

EmbraceSQL generates code to call all stored procedures in the database, along
with React hooks to call stored procedures from the UI, through an EmbraceSQL
generated REST server, to the database, and back again. And you don't have to 
code any of it.

## Requirements

Make sure you are read as specified in the [Cookbook](./).

## Steps

### Write a Stored Procedure

Here is a stored procedure example from the [dvdrental](../../dvdrental.sql) 
database. Pure API, it's even stateless in that it doesn't store data.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.last_day(timestamp without time zone) RETURNS date
    LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE STRICT
    AS $_$
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM $1) = 12 THEN
(((EXTRACT(YEAR FROM $1) + 1)
                    OPERATOR(pg_catalog. ||) '-01-01')::date - INTERVAL '1 day')::date
        ELSE
((EXTRACT(YEAR FROM $1)
                    OPERATOR(pg_catalog. ||) '-' OPERATOR(pg_catalog. ||)(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM $1) + 1)
                    OPERATOR(pg_catalog. ||) '-01')::date - INTERVAL '1 day')::date
        END
$_$;


ALTER FUNCTION public.last_day(timestamp without time zone) OWNER TO postgres;
```

### Generate Code

Regenerate from the database. If you are already running NextJS, it'll hot reload.

<CodeBlock language="shell" >
  {GenerateSource}
</CodeBlock>

### Code React

Import the generated hook. 

EmbraceSQL includes database friendly utilities including type parsers and
react utility hooks to capture UI changes.


<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="src/app/procedure/page.tsx" >
  {ReactSource}
