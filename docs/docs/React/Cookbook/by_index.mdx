# Database Table by Index

Sometimes you just want just a few rows, and you want it fast. 

EmbraceSQL generates a `useRows` hook for every index on every table.


## Requirements

Make sure you are read as specified in the [Cookbook](./).

## Steps

### Generate Code

Now that there is a SQL Script - regenerate from the database. If you are already
running NextJS, it'll hot reload.

<CodeBlock language="shell" >
  {GenerateSource}
</CodeBlock>

### Code React

Now use a table hook. Note the options to paginate and sort.

<CodeBlock language="tsx" title="src/app/by_index/page.tsx" >
  {ReactSource}
</CodeBlock>
