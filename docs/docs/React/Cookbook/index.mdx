# Cookbook üßë‚Äçüç≥

What's an API guide without a cookbook? In here you will find recipes for
common database use cases.

The examples are coded up as stand alone NextJS pages. Client only examples
will convert well to ViteJS.

<Requirements/>

## NextJS

You are going to need:

* NextJS >= 14
* An AppRouter application

## Steps

This will set up your NextJS to be able to use EmbraceSQL.

### Add EmbraceSQL

Package ahoy! üö¢

```shell
npm install @embracesql/shared
npm install @embracesql/react
```

### Generate Code

Generate code, note that we have a command line switch to look for SQL
scripts in a designated folder.

<CodeBlock language="shell" >
  {GenerateSource}
</CodeBlock>

### Create a Server

Here is a route handler that will connect the server-side part of your NextJS
application directly to your PostgreSQL, and expose it to the client-side part.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="./src/app/embracesql/route.ts">
  {RouteSource}
</CodeBlock>
