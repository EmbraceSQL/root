# embracesqlcli

Use this command line tool for all your EmbraceSQL needs. 

You can quickly invoke it with:

```shell
npx embracesqlcli
```

No need to specifically install it into your local node.

## generate

Use this sub command to generate code. 
All code generations are in TypeScript. Code is emitted to `stdout`, so you just
pipe `|` or redirect `>` the output as needed.

Descriptive messages, status, and decorations are all directed to `stderr` so
they won't end up in your generated output.

### node

When you want to make a node program, this is the generation option for you.
The code generated gives you access to your target database via [AutoCRUD](./autocrud.mdx)
and [SQL Scripts](./sql.mdx).

### express

When you want to make an [Express](./express.mdx) application, this
option will generate the code you need. 

### react

When you want to make a a [React](./react.mdx) application, specifically
the client side React code, this is what you need.

You will need to pair the client-side React with a server-side code for Express.
