# Security

EmbraceSQL also embraces security ðŸ‘®.

However, we don't pretend to know your security requirements, so we provide
the ability to inject [middleware](./middleware) into the EmbraceSQL processing stack to
let you secure however you like.

## SQL Middleware

SQL middleware is inspired by HTTP middleware stacks. The idea is you can put
in zero or more middleware functions into your SQL processing stack which allows
you to:
* Run an SQL statement before your actual query

### Database Security

Most folks won't do this, but you plenty well can have a database user for
each of your actual users, and collect their username and password, send those
along on the database connection URL (make sure HTTPS!) and use the database
as the security provider.

Old ðŸŽ“.

### `ROLE` Based Security 

The SQL standard has a notion of `ROLE` that you can use to set permissions
within your database. EmbraceSQL comes out of the box with `ROLE` based security
available.

The idea is straightforward, when you go to invoke an EmbraceSQL request, you
supply a `ROLE` header, and that becomes the database `ROLE` for the invocation
of the query. 

This way one single *service account* can switch security level on the fly.


<CodeBlock language="typescript" >
  {RoleSource}
</CodeBlock>

Here is an example of using a `ROLE` header in a *server side* scenario.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" >
  {RoleSQLSource}
</CodeBlock>

Here is an example of passing along a `ROLE` via HTTP client. Note that for
this to be a *secure* security approach, you will need to prevent client
side tampering.


<CodeBlock language="typescript" >
  {RoleClientSource}
</CodeBlock>


## Express Middleware

If you are using EmbraceSQL mounted in Express, everything you already know
about middleware still applies for authentication and authorization.

Some ideas:
* Use JWT to identify individual users and then set the database `ROLE` header.
* Use user session cookies to set the database `ROLE` header.

## NextJS Functions

Similar to Express, in your route handler running server side, 
you can intercept and set the `ROLE` header before transmission to the database.
