# Reliability

Stuff breaks 💔. EmbraceSQL tries to make this less painful.


## End to End Retry

Interrupted networks connections happen unpredictably. Particularly in containerized
setups, servers are starting and stopping. Load balancers are taking services
in and out. 

These interruptions can happen between client/web, web/api, and api/database. Folks
know that retry logic is an effective technique to mask transient errors -- but
coding up all those retries, and coding them both client and server is a huge chore ⛏️.

EmbraceSQL provides a `retries` option, which can be set that will automatically
retry calls - both client and server - with exponential backoff.

You can set this overall on [EmbraceSQLClient](./React/Cookbook/client_retry).
