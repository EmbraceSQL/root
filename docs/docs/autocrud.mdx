# AutoCRUD

AutoCRUD looks at tables, and their indexes and creates a functional interface
allowing you to work with tables in a similar fashion to KV-stores.

This is easier than writing your own CRUD methods, and easier that an ORM, as it
creates flexible database access:

* Without you writing any SQL or wrapper functions
* Without you specifiying any 'model' or 'pojo' data holders
* Against your existing database, without making any schema changes
* Without learning yet another 'schema language'

All you need are tables with indexes. Yes, primary keys count!

## Steps

Here is a step by step guide to create a command line node program
to access the dvdrental sample database.


### Generate an Node Database

Go into a nice blank directory.

```shell
npm install @embracesql/express
npm pkg set type=module
mkdir -p ./src
npx embracesqlcli generate node --database postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/dvdrental > ./src/dvdrental.ts
```

### Code up a Node Program
We provide handy tsconfig settings that work great with `tsx` and `typescript` 5+.

Create two files as shown.

<CodeBlock language="json" title="tsconfig.json">
  {TsConfigSource}
</CodeBlock>


<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="./src/autocrud.ts">
  {ClientSource}
</CodeBlock>

### Test It!

Start that server:

```shell
npx tsx ./src/autocrud.ts
```

## Details

AutoCRUD generates per schema, per table, per index function calls to:

* Create via `INSERT`, with `ON CONFLICT` support
* Read via `SELECT`
* Update via `UPDATE`
* Delete via `DELETE`

You call these functions with TypeScript, with strong types for inputs and outputs -- and of course intellisense.

This isn't like an ORM where you 'make sql with functions', it's like more like
the database is exposed as a key-value store by unique index, along with result sets
of objects for non-unique indexes.

You aren't generating SQL at runtime, instead the sql is pregenerated. This helps
on performance, and debuggability - the generated database access code is just
a single TypeScript file. Go ahead and set breakpoints in it!

All methods utilize Postgres `RETURNING` so you get the rows modified back
in a single trip to the database. You'll appreciate this if you have an active
database with triggers and functions that modifiy columns separate from your
TypeScript code. Simply cache/stash/return the modified rows!

Unique indexes, like primary keys, return a single row `{Schema}.{Table}`
-- saving you the `[0]` game.

Non unique indexes return a `List<{Schema}.{Table}>`.

### Reads

Reads work along indexes with methods generated of the format `{Schema}.{Table}.by{IndexColumns}`.

If you need another way to read rows, just add an index.

### Deletes

Deletes work along indexes with methods generated of the format `{Schema}.{Table}.deleteBy{IndexColumns}`.

Deletes get rid of rows. Nothing surprising here, unless you have foreign
keys without `ON DELETE CASCADE`, in which case you won't actually be deleting
and rows after all ðŸ˜‰.

### Updates

Deletes work along indexes with methods generated of the format `{Schema}.{Table}.updateBy{IndexColumns}`.

Updates allow partial of full updates, passing in `values` that can be
any subset of columns that you like. The update statement is smart in that
it will take your new passed in values, or leave the existing database value
without generating a dynamic sql string.

This does rely on TypeScript properties you do NOT want to change to be `undefined`
on the passed in `values`. The easiest way to get this is to have an inline `{column: value}`
passed to `values` for what you want to change, and omit columns you do not want to change.

To null a column, pass `null` for the value like `{email: null}`.

If you have an active database with constraints and triggers, updates can fail, raising
an exception back.

### Creates

Creates have one method per table generated of the format `{Schema}.{Table}.create`.

Pass in values, get a whole new row from the database. If the row exists, it will
upsert automatically.

Creating rows recognizes defaults.

Primary keys often have defaults defined with

* `SMALLSERIAL`
* `SERIAL`
* `BIGSERIAL`
* `DEFAULT nextval()` from a sequence.

These keys are created from defaults in the database.
This means primary key attributes are optional in TypeScript, and you probably
want to leave them undefined in order to have the database create you a primary key.

Columns beyond the primary key can have defaults as well, `created_date` is a common
pattern here. To get the database default, just don't pass a value for the column.

The good news is the `RETURNING` row will show you the primary key as
created by the database.

You can pass in `values` with the primary key - particularly when you
intend to get an upsert. Or if you are on purpose 'setting' the primary key
and bypassing the default.

### Upserts

Creates automatically upsert, turning the `INSERT` into an `UPDATE`, `RETURNING`
the modified row.

## Transactions

What would a database library be without transactions?

Just pass a callback function, throw to abort, return clean to commit.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="./src/transactions.ts">
  {TransactionsSource}
</CodeBlock>
